Apiculus Cloud Console is the topmost layer on a technology stack that is fine-tuned and optimised for performance, features and experience. The Apiculus solution uses Enterprise-grade components to handle various facets of infrastructure management and service delivery.
Billing on Apiculus Cloud works on a subscription model. In line with modern-day apps and services, subscription billing models are an efficient way to deliver service value as a pay-as-you-go license. This not only eliminates heavy upfront costs for any service purchase, but also gives you the flexibility to cancel at any time and pay for only the amount or duration of use.
The following payment gateways are supported on Apiculus to receive payments:
Apiculus supports SMS gateways that can be used for sending SMS notifications, sending one-time passwords (OTP) and verifying mobile number ownership. The following SMS gateways are supported:
Apiculus offers a single login page for subscribers and admins alike, and redirects based on the type of user who is logging in (subscriber, reseller, admin).

Apiculus Admin Console is the top level experience management layer in the Apiculus solution stack. This is the control panel where service providers' Product, Marketing and Business teams spend most of their time and manage various facets of the cloud delivery and management experience for the end customers.
Apiculus Admin Console offers role-based access control (RBAC) for all admin users. The system ships with default roles, with rights and privileges as outlined in this article.
The Apiculus solution is built using an 'integrations' approach using Independent Software Vendor (ISV) products that are enterprise-grade and deliver powerful technical orchestration capabilities.
Service provider Network Operations Center (NOC) teams get restricted access to the Zabbix monitoring system as part of the service provider administration suite. Restricted access is granted because any modifications done to the Zabbix system can severely impact the quality of service and experience delivered via Apiculus.
Apiculus Admin Console enables end-to-end service management via tickets using OTRS Community Edition. Service providers get agent and admin access to OTRS for being able to onboard their helpdesk teams and configure workflows as needed.
The Apiculus solution stack includes the open-source BI tool Metabase, which can be configured to deliver powerful business and commercial reporting insights. Service providers' techno-commercial teams (Product, Operations, Business, Upper Management, C-Suite) can configure and access highly customisable visual dashboards to gain visibility into how the cloud business is being operated using Apiculus.
Any request, query or bug report can be raised as a ticket with Apiculus (By Yotta) Support via email. This also includes forwarding tickets raised by the end customers on Apiculus Cloud Console or any other channels permitted by service providers. Apiculus (By Yotta) Support does not respond directly to end-customer tickets and only acts as L2+ escalation.

Document URL - https://docs.apiculus.com/docs/Administration/ServicesManagement/WorkingwithAvailabilityZones
Availability Zones (AZ) on Apiculus are a highly versatile and unique way of managing Service delivery and availability. Apiculus AZs are essentially control planes for underlying ISV, designed to handle a range of delivery scenarios. Apiculus AZs also take into account the limitations that an ISV may have (e.g., inability to manage multiple serviceable regions via a single management plane). In other words, Apiculus AZ can be seen as the 'delivery-level unification' of all underlying cloud services into a unified service topology.
The following is a description of AZ for each type of Service that uses AZ:
To map a new availability zone, navigate toServices > Availability Zonesand click on the+ MAP NEW AVAILABILITY ZONEbutton. The following screen appears:
In the add Availability Zone window, enter the following details:
Once you have filled in the details and made the selections, click on theCREATE AVAILABILITY ZONE.
If you want to save these createdAvailability Zonesas a draft, click on theSAVE AS DRAFTbutton and cancel the action, click on theCANCELbutton.
Disabling or Deleting an AZ will cascade into all the Cloud Collections, Default Services and Custom Catalogues that use the AZ.
Currently, only the option to map CloudStack-based AZs is available on the Apiculus Admin Console UI. Support for other types of AZs is being developed.
Working with Availability Zones

Apiculus Cloud Console is the white-label CMP (cloud management platform) that subscribers and end-customers will use to manage their cloud as delivered by their service provider. Primarily, cloud management on Apiculus Cloud Console has two main 'journey maps' that all end-customers follow as part of their life cycle on Apiculus. These are:
Setting up and managing cloud resources on¬†Apiculus Cloud Console¬†follows a highly intuitive approach that is built on the UX principles of modern-day software. The Cloud Console user journeys are simple, visual, and information-rich which makes managing cloud resources extremely satisfying.

Document URL - https://docs.apiculus.com/docs/category/account-centre-1
The Account Centre on the Apiculus Cloud Console is a non-technical (commercial and support) dashboard used for viewing and managing all non-technical aspects of your Apiculus Cloud account. You can access the Account Centre by clicking on any item in the user menu at the top-right, the help/support icon in the header, or the wallet icon in the header.
Using the¬†Profile¬†section, you can manage your organisation account profile on Apiculus Cloud. The profile management section can be accessed from the Account Centre in the top helper bar by clicking on the organisation.. Account profiles include the following:
Team members or child users can be onboarded using the¬†TEAM¬†section from the Account Centre. Apiculus Cloud allows you to add billing, technical, or other admin users who can log in to your account and perform operations.
A subscription is a record created whenever a new resource is purchased or a service is activated. In other words, a subscription is a financial ‚Äòagreement‚Äô that links the item that has been purchased, its value, and its renewal frequency.
All subscriptions incur prorated charges during an account‚Äôs billing cycle. These charges, also known as unbilled charges, can be accessed from Billing > Unbilled Charges in the main navigation panel.
Invoices are generated at the end of each billing cycle for the services consumed during the billing cycle. Invoices can be accessed from the¬†Billing > Invoices & Credit Notes¬†section on the main navigation panel.
For all practical purposes, the¬†service balance¬†acts as your wallet balance or purchase capacity at any given point of time. The service balance is an aggregation of your credit limit, total payments made, and the total charges incurred on your account. Your service balance is always displayed on the top bar and gets updated in real-time when a transaction or a charge is recorded.
Apiculus Cloud supports three ways of making payments or adding money to the wallet:
Apiculus Cloud provides SLA-driven support to all subscriber customers in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in the Service Level Agreement. To access the SLA, navigate to the User icon in the top helper bar and select Account under Account Centre.
Standard agreements and documents are available on the Apiculus Cloud Console Account Centre. Whenever any of these documents is amended or updated, you will be prompted to accept the modified documents on your next login.

The¬†Tools and Utilities¬†sections in the Apiculus Cloud Console keep a record of cloud management utilities and assets that might be needed to use specific sections of the Apiculus-powered cloud.
The Apiculus Cloud Console allows you to create secure shell connections to Instances in your account by using SSH keys, in addition to using Instance passwords. Since passwords can be easily compromised, SSH keys provide a more secure alternative. These keys function as encrypted signatures and work only when their public and private components match.

This is a minor release with a few new features and enhancements across the Apiculus¬Æ system. In this release, key enhancements include a new pricing system for RHEL instances, service plan visibility options, and significant catalogue management process improvements.
Apiculus now supports a detailed  Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) pricing model based on virtual CPU (vCPU) core slabs. Administrators can configure pricing per Red Hat‚Äôs standard core model, which includes:
Service provider admins can easily define pricing tiers via the Apiculus admin portal, streamlining the setup for various RHEL instance types. End-users benefit from an easy provisioning process by accessing theRHEL Instancessection under theComputemenu. This feature ensures a seamless experience for configuring and deploying RHEL instances, offering full access to all RHEL features.
Service providers now have the flexibility to control service plan visibility by offering hourly, monthly, or both options for all services (except for account-level services like Data Transfer, Secondary Storage, DNS Management, and Instance Protection). Admins can tailor the offering based on customer requirements, whether for short-term usage via hourly plans or long-term service subscriptions via monthly plans. This customisation enables more precise service offerings and better alignment with customer preferences.
The new Catalogue Cloning feature enhances the ease of managing custom catalogues. Administrators can now duplicate existing catalogues, adjust pricing, add or remove packs, and assign them to specific user accounts. This feature significantly reduces the time spent creating catalogues from scratch, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. By using cloned catalogues, service providers can quickly adapt to changing business requirements and user demands without starting the process a new one.

This is a major release with a new feature, a refresh of existing features, and enhancements across the Apiculus system.
In this release, Apiculus embraces multicurrency support, allowing service providers to offer their services in various currencies tailored to the preferences of individual customers. End-users now have the flexibility to sign up with a currency different from the base currency supported by the service providers, with their accounts reflecting the chosen currency. Service providers can conveniently choose a currency during customer onboarding and establish default credit limits for each selected currency.
Building on the user experience enhancements introduced in version 2.0, Apiculus presents a revamped and user-friendly interface for the Object Storage service. Service provider admins can now easily enable the service and configure prices, while end-users enjoy an intuitive experience when utilising the service.
The AutoScale feature in Apiculus undergoes a comprehensive refresh, transitioning from the previous Ragnar and Zabbix combination to CloudStack's native AutoScale feature.

Document URL - https://docs.apiculus.com/docs/ReleaseNotes/Ver2000
This is a major release that introduces a completely new face (and phase) for Apiculus. With this version - now known as Apiculus Cloud Console - we're bringing a brand new UX with awesome new features! The all new Apiculus Cloud Console focuses on simplicity and give the users a great feel with an excellent and delightful Apiculus experience. We have also trimmed the fat and removed what was not needed.
Apiculus has introduced a completely new way of managing cloud Services. You can add Availability Zones, create Cloud Collections, create Custom Catalogues, or simply manage Default Services - all by yourself using the Admin Console. You can now quickly define which services to offer, from where to offer and what price to offer, and even if a specific set of customers need to cater in a different catalogue; this all can be done from the admin UI in a simple, efficient and quick manner.
The services section consists of the below four major sub-sections:
The Apiculus subscriber experience is now delivered via an entirely new UI with a simple and intuitive UX that helps the user to do everything on the cloud portal seamlessly and effortlessly. This is not all - we'll be constantly upping the game in order to create delightful experiences, and this is only the beginning.
The business end of the interface has now been separated from the day-to-day operational end in order to create a more focused experience for the end users. The Account Centre has been introduced as a single complete view where all information regarding the organisation, billing, invoices, account policies, tickets and other useful links can be viewed and accessed. Users can very easily switch back and forth between the Account Centre and cloud views, thus making the focus that much easier to achieve.
Signing up as an end user is now a completely new process that does away with long form fills. Just start with the bare minimum details and you're good to go. We want your customers to feel zero friction in signing up for your cloud, and we have taken all measures to ensure that. The Dashboard has also been simplified and decluttered, and now focuses only on the most important bit of information that any organisation needs to know - what they're spending.
Apiculus Kubernetes service has also received a complete refresh as we've replaced the K3s+Rancher combination with CloudStack's native Kubernetes service (CKS). This also helps us deliver features like high availability clusters, cluster scaling options, root disk sizing, reusability of Compute offerings, better support for CSI and CNI plugins, cluster dashboard and much more.
Virtual Firewall gets a new flow and an easier way of activating the service. Apiculus now supports FortiGate VM in addition to pfSense to deliver the virtual firewall appliances. While currently limited to a choice between the two, this gives you an option to strategise between offering an open-source appliance and owning the support, or offering a supported appliance altogether. Apiculus uses L2 networks for this service, which work in a manner similar to the VR-based VPC service.
A lot of legacy components have been removed. The significant ones that you'll notice on the new UI are:
We have a lot more that's coming your way in 2023 and we couldn't be more excited to share these announcements. But, all in due time :)

Compute & Storage and Network Services - since these services now have their own dedicated sections on the UI, we felt no need to keep these options and, hence, have done away with them. We'll soon we removing the Value Added Services marketplace as well.
Welcome Tour - we believe we can never match up to the options and capabilities that are provided by Digital Adoption Platforms (DAP). Hence, to make way for DAPs, which can be connected using our killer Google Tag Manager integration, we've opened up the plate for you and given you the choice to customise how you wish your customers to be onboarded and taken through the platform. After all, it's¬†your cloud!

More layout options added for the Welcome page
Options added for displaying different logos at different places (main navigation, email, Account Centre etc.)

This is a major release with many new features and enhancements across the Apiculus system.
We are now ready with one of the most exciting additions to our feature set. Apiculus now works directly with CloudStack's REST APIs, which opens up tremendous possibilities to execute an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) paradigm. API-based provisioning and management, using Terraform providers, scripting using automation tools - are all now a reality on Apiculus. We've introduced this for the key IaaS components of VM, VPC, disks and networks, and will soon be extending this to other services as well.
Apiculus adds one more handy offering to its marketplace as the object as a service is available as integration with Cloudian HyperStore, and the service providers can offer this fantastic service now. Customers or organizations can create buckets, upload objects, view the usages for buckets, etc. This service can be activated by customers simply from the marketplace section.
For service providers wishing to offer firewall virtual domains as a service, Apiculus has got it covered as an integration with FortiGate. Subscribers can now view and activate this service from network services in the marketplace. It‚Äôs an approval-based process, so whenever a subscriber activates the firewall virtual domains as a service, the admin needs to approve the same. Furthermore, this subscriber UI will have all Virtual Domains and firewalls listed along with interfaces, static routes, etc. We have also provided a manage button that will redirect the user to the FortiGate console.
We have added support for multiple payment gateways on Apiculus. Service providers can provide multiple payment gateways option to the end users. Users can view the multiple gateway options once they are making a payment by clicking Pay Now, and they need to choose the payment gateway from the available options and proceed further.
Now on Apiculus, admins can block free email providers as per their wish. Admins can do this by navigating to the global settings general section and selecting restrict self-signup using free email provider IDs. They can choose the email providers from the list of free email provider domains. Login to your admin account and check it now!
Apiculus now offers app-level security enhancements like password rotation, restriction from repeated passwords and auto-lockout on failed password attempts. Admins can configure all these simply from the Passwords section present under platform settings.
On Apiculus, admins can now configure the session timeout for the user session as per their desired choice. Admins can configure this from the settings general section and then define the required inputs under session timeout.

This is a major release with many new features and enhancements across the apiculus¬Æ system.
The Bare Metal service is now fully automated with no need for manual steps on the underlying system. It‚Äôs a push-button experience like VMs, with an approval mechanism built on top. We've also taken care of updating the machine inventory in real-time so that the end-users can deploy a Bare Metal machine with minimal hoops.
Apiculus¬Æ subscriber users now have the option to download data disks. The data disk download process is straightforward and a convenient feature for the end-users. Whenever a volume is detached from a VM, the subscriber can download the volume by just clicking on the 'Download Volume' button.
Apiculus¬Æ subscribers can now revert their existing VMs to the snapshot state(s). Simply, this means that if any end-user has taken a snapshot of any of their VMs, they can revert their VM to the reference point at which the snapshot was/has been created.
The global 'Settings' on the Apiculus¬Æ Admin Console is now a more robust feature for admins. Admins now have many more configurations and localisation options available on the Admin Console. We are working hard towards giving a lot more control to service providers on how they wish to deliver their cloud experience to their customers and end-users. A lot of restructuring has also been done and the following options are available as configurable settings:
New trial programme triggers have been added which can support automated trial enrollments for new self-signup accounts. Additionally, admin-assisted accounts can be directly enrolled into a trial programme. We've also added an automation action for 'enrolling into a trial programme' so that service providers can offer ramped-up trials - the kind that go like '100% free for 6 months, 50% discount for the next 6, 25% discount for the next 6, and full-price thereafter'
We're readying the system to support API-based provisioning and a whole new experience of creating your service offerings. We're excited - believe us! Reach us on product(at)indiqus(dot)com for more details!

This is a major release with a lot of new features across the apiculus¬Æ system.
We have added a new feature called tax deductions on apiculus¬Æ Admin console. Admins now will be able to configure tax deductions via a new section under Settings called Tax Deductions. This involves taxes deducted by the customers while making a payment and is different from taxation on services which involves taxes charged on the services delivered.
We have added the capability to enter the contract details manually where the admin users can customize the fields to collect the data as per their requirement. For subscriptions that are already created, admins will be able to view the corresponding contract. Admins can now associate contracts to the existing subscriptions also.
Now on the apiculus¬Æ Admin console we have the option of changing the customers primary email id. The customer's primary email id can be changed anytime in simple and verified steps and the notification will go to both the new and old email ids. No need to worry if some primary email id is no longer used. One can avoid the deactivation and creation of new accounts using this feature!
Now apiculus¬Æ has the provision from Admin console to add positive and negative line items as one-time subscriptions that will be a great boost to billing-related workflows. This will act as a powerful standalone as well as auxiliary feature.

This is a major release with a new service available on the marketplace.
We've added a new dimension to networking on apiculus¬Æ. Advanced networking now has a new flavour called Free Networks in addition to EC and VPC.
Behind the scenes, CloudStack's L2 networking has been extended to apiculus¬Æ, which in combination with pfSense, brings loads of benefits in how service providers can offer UTM and networking. This also brings additional advantages around IP conservation in countries where procuring public IP addresses might not be economical.
To begin with, this integration is available as a semi-automated process and we'll be extending this to a fully automated, self-service user experience in the upcoming releases.
We've added Twilio as a standard SMS gateway integration available on apiculus¬Æ. While service providers will still have the option to use their own preferred SMS (and payment) gateways, Twilio (in combination with Paypal for payments) brings a truste global flavour to small, medium and large service providers who are powered by apiculus¬Æ.
Version 1.15.0.0

This is a major release with a lot of new features across the apiculus¬Æ system.
We've added the ability to create trial programmes and manage trials or PoC accounts. Administrators and account managers can specify a trial duration (days) and programme benefits (percentage discount), and enrol accounts in the programmes.
This feature brings the flexibility to create single-window trials as well as more complex ramp-up trials. Further, trial management also gives the control to the administrators and account managers to schedule trial enrolments.
As an extension to trial programmes, we've also added two new triggers for global and account-level automation - trial programme beginning and trial programme expiry. Using these, trial customers can be engaged with more personally, and service provider sales teams can get a few steps closer to converting them to paying customers.
The long awaited root disk resize for virtual machines is finally here. Honestly, we're also surprised that it took us so long to get here. But water under the bridge, IaaS users can now resize their VM root disks to whatever configurations are enabled by the service provider.
For service providers who wish to offer bare metal services along with IaaS, apiculus¬Æ has got it covered as an integration with Canonical's MAAS. Any bare metal inventory can now be offered through the apiculus¬Æ marketplace with a lot of pricing levers, such as custom components, managed services inclusions, price overrides etc.
Further, users can view all their bare metal resources as well as start or stop them.
For service provider teams who are dealing in a large number of credit notes and offline payments, this feature will come as a boon! No more will it be required to go into each account and add payments or create credit notes one by one.
Instead, administrators and billing/financial managers can just download the template files, fill them up and upload - the system will take care of everything else!

This is a major release with just one feature.
Apiculus¬Ænow supports multiple geographically spaced out availability regions as part of a single deployment environment. This essentially translates to apiculus¬Æ being able to talk to multiple Apache CloudStack setups behind the scenes. With this, service providers no longer need to be constrained by a single-orchestrator setup, and can have a much wider outlook while defining their cloud strategy.
A detailed note on the benefits of this feature can be found here -https://www.apiculus.com/blog/manage-geographically-separate-regions-from-a-single-pane-of-glass/
To incorporate Regions, small changes have been done across the system:
Version 1.13.0.0

What Has Changed?‚Äã
While signing up, subscribers can choose their 'default' region. This will enable them to choose a region that's closer to them.
Default regions can also be assigned while creating an account from the administration console.
Subscribers will need to 'enable' new regions, which can be done while switching between regions in the marketplace.
Region-wise infrastructure utilisation reports can also be seen on the administration console.

This is a major release with a lot of new features across the apiculus¬Æ system.
We‚Äôve changed a fair bit of things on the apiculus¬Æ Admin Console, starting right with the navigation structure. The Admin Console is now more intuitive and gives more information in a ready-to-use manner. Whether it‚Äôs Metabase-powered dashboards or simply a list of all unpaid invoices, we‚Äôve covered it all.
All Metabase dashboards can now be viewed directly on apiculus¬Æ. This provides ready access to accounts, billing, marketing, marketplace, and support reports for all administrator users on apiculus¬Æ Admin Console.
The apiculus¬Æ Admin Console now comes with more self-configuration capabilities. We‚Äôve added new options in the Settings section using which platform administrators can change a lot of configurations. This also includes encryption of all sensitive data during transfer and at rest, just to add that extra layer of security.
This is just the beginning - we‚Äôll be adding a lot more configurations and settings in the coming releases so that administrators get the power to change platform behaviours themselves.
We‚Äôve added a fourth method for creating credit notes against invoices, wherein admins can choose the exact invoice line items to generate credit notes with.
This comes in addition to options for creating credit notes with the full invoice amount, partial invoice amount and custom line items.

Document URL - https://docs.apiculus.com/docs/Introduction/BillingConcepts
Billing on Apiculus Cloud works on a subscription model. In line with modern-day apps and services, subscription billing models are an efficient way to deliver service value as a pay-as-you-go license. This not only eliminates heavy upfront costs for any service purchase, but also gives you the flexibility to cancel at any time and pay for only the amount or duration of use.
To understand the various billing and financial aspects of Apiculus Cloud, it is essential to be aware of certain billing concepts:
All billing records related to your account on Apiculus Cloud can be accessed from the respective sections underBilling and Financialin the main navigation panel.
Billing Concepts
Billing on Apiculus Cloud‚Äã
Billing Cycle:By default, Apiculus Cloud follows a monthly billing cycle from the 1st to the 31st (or 30th or 28th) of each month. Any resource or service purchased during the billing cycle will be invoiced in the next month.
Billing Frequency:Services can have their own billing or renewal frequencies. This is essentially the time period for which the resource or service is rated and billed for. These can be:Hourly (mainly for virtual machines and disks)Monthly (for most of the available services)WeeklyQuarterlyHalf-yearlyYearlyOne-time
Hourly (mainly for virtual machines and disks)
Monthly (for most of the available services)
Weekly
Quarterly
Half-yearly
Yearly
One-time
Billing Model:Apiculus Cloud follows a billing model determined by a credit limit that your account has been offered. This credit limit is a value that you can purchase services and resources up to without running the risk of account restriction, disablement, or termination. Credit limits can be enhanced by Apiculus based on your usage and payment track records.
Service Balance:In simple terms, the service balance is your current purchase capacity on Apiculus Cloud. The service balance includes your credit limit, payments that you have made and all charges that you have incurred on your subscriptions and is denoted using a ‚Äòwallet‚Äô metaphor.

Apiculus allows service providers to manage their subscriber/customer life cycles end to end. Subscriber account is one of the key entities that the entire solution is designed for. While Apiculus supports many features that impact the subscriber life cycles, this section focuses only on actions that can be performed within the¬†Accounts¬†section of the Apiculus service provider admin panel.
Creating New Subscriber Accounts
Apiculus enables customer life cycle management using states depending on where the relationship with individual customers stands in their life cycle. The following states are supported:
Apiculus provides a means for service provider support teams to login to a customer account and impersonate the subscriber. This is a useful tool for providing instant/on-call support.
Subscriber accounts' credit limits and other billing details can be updated from the Apiculus Admin Console.
The Apiculus Admin Console allows you to change the customer‚Äôs primary email ID. The Primary email ID can be updated anytime through simple and verifiable steps with the notification sent to both the new and old email IDs.
Service provider admins on Apiculus can change customers' taxation categories. This feature is useful for organisations acquiring special tax status, exemption status, or dealing with incorrect classification while creating an account.
The Apiculus Admin Console allows to set up default KYC-based restrictions for both self-signup and admin-assisted accounts. When enabled, the respective account types will not be able to make purchases anything till their KYC/identity verification has been completed.
Subscriber accounts are created with default global resource limits that are defined in the Apache CloudStack orchestrator. These limits can be adjusted for subscriber accounts by navigating into the target account and selecting the¬†Limits¬†sub-section. These limits are vary for each cloud region that's configured to deliver services.
The Apiculus Cloud Console enables users to easily view information on designated relationship personnel, as specified by the service providers. Using the Admin Console, service providers can keep this information updated for each subscriber account.

Availability Zones (AZ) on Apiculus are a highly versatile and unique way of managing Service delivery and availability. Apiculus AZs are essentially control planes for underlying ISV, designed to handle a range of delivery scenarios. Apiculus AZs also take into account the limitations that an ISV may have (e.g., inability to manage multiple serviceable regions via a single management plane). In other words, Apiculus AZ can be seen as the 'delivery-level unification' of all underlying cloud services into a unified service topology.
A Cloud Collection (CC) on Apiculus is a grouping of repeating components (called Collection Items) that can be published to offer options/configurations for subscribers to choose from when purchasing a cloud resource. Apiculus CC can be based on a variety of factors, some examples of which are listed below:

The Billing and Financials section is designed to give complete details of the Apiculus billing system. This section gives administrators of Apiculus complete access to customers‚Äô billing records, invoices, transactions, and other financial items supported on Apiculus.
Admins on Apiculus can deactivate subscriptions from the Admin Cloud Console which will, in turn, remove the resource(s) from the corresponding system(s).
The Apiculus Admin Cloud Console offers an easy way of handling subscription price changes. Admins can update subscription prices after a resource has been created and bring the new prices in effect from the current billing cycle.
You can add charges and discounts manually as one-time subscriptions. It is beneficial for the use cases; if the invoice is generated and some discount or charge needs to be recorded for a customer, then you can do the same. This feature significantly enhances billing-related workflows.
You can view all invoices that are generated on the Apiculus system. Apiculus stores invoices as downloadable and printable¬†.pdf¬†files that are stored on the Apiculus management server(s) on the service provider premises.
Estimates provide a better control to admin users and integrate seamlessly with IRP/ERP systems for effective invoice management. It reduces manual data entry errors by automating the invoicing process and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for e-invoicing, such as generating Invoice Reference Numbers (IRN) and integrating with tax authorities.
To view the invoice, navigate to the Billing and Financial section and select Invoices.
You can create credit notes against paid or unpaid invoices. A credit note requires an invoice to be generated and present in the system. Credit notes can be used in cases such as disputed invoices, disputed charges, refunds etc., where editing an invoice is not financially possible.
Apiculus offers the means to upload credit notes in bulk (generate unique credit notes based on multiple linked invoices).
Like invoices, credit notes are also stored as downloadable and printable¬†.pdf¬†files on the Apiculus management servers on the service provider premises. These can be¬†downloaded and viewed in the same way as invoices, and can be accessed from account-level and global credit notes listings.
You can resend credit notes to account owners from the account-level or global credit notes listings.¬†Like invoices, this will only resend the email/file and not create a new credit note.
You can record payments received outside the Apiculus system as Transactions using the Apiculus Admin Cloud Console. These payments may either be against invoices that are open or advance payments that adjust against invoices generated in future.
Payments and transactions (online and offline), once recorded in the system, can be viewed in detail, including their amounts, dates, references, modes, narrations and apportionments.
Transactions and payments, once received and recorded, can not be edited. In case of refunds or cancellations, a reverse entry must be made in the accounting books. All online and offline transactions (with the exception of credit notes) can be reversed by clicking on ¬†Reverse Icon (reverse icon) in an account-level or global transactions listing, or by clicking the¬†Reverse¬†icon while¬†viewing transaction details.
Transaction receipts can be viewed for any transaction in an account-level or global listing by clicking on the Receipt (receipt¬†icon). This will show the current status of any transaction along with transaction reference, associated information, details received from payment gateway etc.
You can configure tax deductions via a new section under Settings called Tax Deductions.¬†This involves taxes deducted by customers while making a payment and is different from taxation on services which involves taxes charged on the services delivered. Admins can record quarterly tax deductions for all customer invoices. The Tax Deductions section lists all such tax deductions and allows for adding new items. The Tax Deductions feature is optional and needs to be enabled from the global settings, where admins also get the ability to define their country‚Äôs fiscal period and fiscal quarters.
You can view tax deductions recorded quarterly¬†against historical invoices as per¬†fiscal period configurations.

Apiculus supports adding custom<script>elements to the platform's HTML<head>components for execution during rendering of the platform UI in browsers.
This can be useful in a number of cases:
Custom scripts can be added individually to Apiculus Cloud Console and to the Admin Console. To add a custom script, navigate toSettings > Custom Scriptsfrom the user menu on the top right of the Apiculus Admin Console and paste the script in either of the text boxes as appropriate.
The script should be wrapped between<script>and</script>tags.
This is an experimental feature and may cause the platform UI to break if used incorrectly.Use this feature with utmost caution.
Adding Custom Scripts
You want to integrate a clickstream, marketing or analytics tool without using Google Tag Manager due to cross-border restrictions (for example, some countries restrict moving data out to Google).
You want to write a custom function or logic to control how and what elements render on the web page.
You don't want ad-blockers or privacy-focused browsers to flag external scripts (for example, Google Analytics, Tag Manager etc.) as ads.

A Cloud Collection (CC) on Apiculus is a grouping of repeating components (called Collection Items) that can be published to offer options/configurations for subscribers to choose from when purchasing a cloud resource. Apiculus CC can be based on a variety of factors, some examples of which are listed below:
Cloud Collections are dependent on Availability Zones, which means that the same collection needs to be created for each AZ to make it available across multiple AZs.
Once a Cloud Collection is created, you can add Collection Items by going into the collection's details and choosing from the upload options. Each collection 'type' has its own specific item types and the Apiculus Admin Console UI lists the sections accordingly. There are two ways of creating Collection Items:
Collections may be published after all required details and items have been added. Publishing a collection makes it available for use in catalogues. Below are some considerations while working with published Collections:
If any resource in the underlying ISV is recreated, the corresponding Collection Item must be updated in Apiculus failing which, any resource purchase action that uses this Collection Item will fail.
Working with Cloud Collections
Creating a New Collection‚Äã
To create a new collection, navigate toServices > Cloud Collections.
Click on theCREATE NEW COLLECTIONbutton.
On the Create New Collection screen, enter the following details:COLLECTION NAME‚Äì¬†The name you want to call this collection.COLLECTION TYPE‚Äì¬†Choose any one of the collection types. The following are the major types of collection available:Operating SystemsComputeDiskVirtual RoutersOS TYPE: If you selectedOperating Systemsas theCOLLECTION TYPE, theOS TYPElist appears, that shows the following options:LinuxWindowsRHELAVAILABILITY ZONE‚Äì¬†Choose an availability zones from the list.DISPLAY TITLE‚Äì¬†Describe the title by which you want to show this collection.COLLECTION PREFIX‚Äì¬†Specify the prefix here, which is prepended to any item purchased from this collection.

Add Using UI‚Äì This option gives a way to create Collection Items individually;¬†useful as chances of misconfigurations are low since the UI shows a list of available options to choose from.
Publishing and Managing Collections‚Äã
A Collection Item can be reverted to draft mode, which will keep it in the system but make it unavailable to all catalogues using it.
Any edits to Collection details and Collection Items must be published, without which, the changes will not propagate to catalogues.
Deleting a Collection will remove it from all catalogues using it.

You can create new subscriber accounts by clicking the+ New Accountbutton above the accounts listing.
The general account creation flow is as follows:
Admins can create accounts from the Admin Console regardless of thesignup modespecified under platform configurations.
Self-signups are accounts that are created without admin intervention. The Apiculus system automates sending of the email verification code and only the subscriber needs to perform the required actions. Until the subscriber verifies their email, self-signup accounts will be visible under theAwaiting Confirmationsection of account management. Admins can resend the verification email to these accounts.
Self-signup accounts treated as 'retail' accounts, are created withRin their account IDs and follow all the configurations and rules applied for self-signup accounts.
The only difference between admin-assisted and admin-initiated signups is that, with admin-assisted signups, when the activesignup mode, a form will be displayed to the subscriber who is signing up. This form will land in theDraftsqueue as a semi-filled form. Admin-initiated signups, on the other hand, need to be started from scratch in the account management section.
Admin-assisted and admin-initiated accounts are treated as 'enterprise' accounts, are created with anEin their account IDs, and follow all the configurations and rules applied to admin-assisted accounts.
Subscriber accounts can be created using the Apiculus Accounts API. These accounts bypass all verification steps and can be used to create subscriber accounts programmatically.
Accounts created using the API are treated as 'enterprise' accounts, are created withEin their account IDs and take all the configurations and rules applied for admin-assisted accounts.
Account information can be updated, and other available actions can be performed by going into the target subscriber account in the Apiculus Admin Console.

Setting up and managing cloud resources onApiculus Cloud Consolefollows a highly intuitive approach that is built on the UX principles of modern-day software. The Cloud Console user journeys are simple, visual, and information-rich which makes managing cloud resources extremely satisfying.
The general guidelines to follow when using the Apiculus Cloud Console to manage cloud resources:
Detailed guides on cloud resource management can be found in the following sections.
Cloud/Operations Management
The Cloud Console dashboard is always accessible in one click (by clicking onDashboardwhile in the cloud management view, or by 'closing' theAccount Centreview). This ensures that it's always easy to restart an experience.
The experience is split into 2 clear divisions (cloud resource managementandaccount management).¬†This ensures complete focus and a very low cognitive load as part of the user experience.
The main navigation bar lists all available services, allowing users to access them with a single click from any section in thecloud management view. This ensures easy access and seamless navigation, making it simple to restart any sub-experience. TheAccount Centrefollows the same approach, enabling users to reach all available sections with a single click.
Resource/Service managementfollows the same UX pattern everywhere and all purchased/provisioned resources can be accessed in the same way, regardless of the Service. This design ensures consistency and predictability in the user experience.
Custom links that include external knowledge bases, videos, media, and other rich information onhow to use Apiculusare always available in thecloud management view. Similarly, commercial information (such as privacy policy, SLA, EULA, etc.) is always available in theAccount Centre view. This design ensures that information is strategically provided on the Cloud Console interface.

A subscription is a record created whenever a new resource is purchased or a service is activated. In other words, a subscription is a financial ‚Äòagreement‚Äô that links the item that has been purchased, its value, and its renewal frequency.
Subscriptions have the following characteristics:
Apiculus Cloud supports the following types of subscriptions:
Subscriptions can be accessed by navigating to theBilling¬† > Subscriptions & Servicesin the main navigation panel of theAccount Centre. This section shows the following information:
The data transfer and secondary storage subscriptions are always enabled by default.
Subscriptions and Services
By default, all subscriptions are set to renew automatically at the end of their billing durations.
By default, all subscriptions are set to prorate on entry as well as on exit. This means that subscriptions created or deleted in the middle of a billing cycle will be charged only for the applicable period, not the entire billing month.
Subscriptions can be canceled (or deactivated) at any time. However, while canceling, you‚Äôll have the option to delete the subscription immediately (instant deletion) or just cancel the automatic renewal (scheduled deletion).
Fixed Recurring -These have a fixed charge for a fixed period and are automatically renewed with the same fixed charges.
Usage-based -These are metered (mostly) in an hourly fashion and are billed on the number of usage hours.
Fixed Non-Recurring -These have a fixed one-time charge and do not require renewal.
Active Subscriptions -a tabulated list of all subscriptions that are currently active in your account.noteThe data transfer and secondary storage subscriptions are always enabled by default.
Inactive Subscriptions -a tabulated list of all subscriptions that were active in the past. This includes all removed subscriptions.
Scheduled for Deletion -a tabulated list of all subscriptions that are set not to renew automatically.

Document URL - https://docs.apiculus.com/docs/category/autoscale-1
The Autoscale feature allows a system to adjust its computing resources based on the changing workload automatically. In virtual machines or instances, autoscaling helps ensure that an application or service has the right amount of resources to handle varying levels of demand efficiently. The key concept behind autoscaling is dynamic resource allocation. When demand for a particular application or service increases, autoscaling automatically adds more computing resources (such as instances or virtual machines) to handle the load. Conversely, during periods of lower demand, autoscaling reduces the number of resources to optimize cost and efficiency.
- Apiculus now uses the native Autoscale feature of ACS. This feature is available with ACS version 4.18.0.0 onwards.

A Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway is a networking component in cloud and on-premises environments that enables resources within a private subnet (such as virtual machines or containers) to connect to the internet or other external networks, without exposing these resources directly to incoming connections from those external networks. This helps in enhancing security in cloud infrastructure by keeping resources in private subnets isolated from direct public access.

Document URL - https://docs.apiculus.com/docs/Subscribers/ToolsandUtilities/ManagingSSHKeysandKeyPairs
The Apiculus Cloud Console allows you to create secure shell connections to Instances in your account by using SSH keys, in addition to using Instance passwords. Since passwords can be easily compromised, SSH keys provide a more secure alternative. These keys function as encrypted signatures and work only when their public and private components match.
SSH keys can be managed from theTools and Utilities > SSH Key Pairssection in the main navigation panel.
You can create SSH keys by two methods:
To generate new SSH key pairs, click theGenerate a new key pairbutton.
This creates a public-private key pair, downloading the private key to your system while storing the public key in your Apiculus Cloud Console account. You can then use the downloaded private key to connect to virtual machines associated with the corresponding public key.
To Upload existing public keys from your system, click theUPLOAD PUBLIC KEYbutton.
This requires you to already have a key pair on your system, and you simply need to upload the contents of the public key (usually a .pub file from your system‚Äôs SSH directory) to your Apiculus Cloud Console account.
To use an Linux Instance with an SSH key, it needs to be associated with a key first. This can be done in two ways:
Once a SSH key pair has been associated with a Linux Instance, theInstance can be accessed via a SSH connection, authenticated with the private key on your local machine.
If a SSH public key is deleted from the Apiculus Cloud Console account, you'll no longer be able to connect to the Linux Instance(s) associated with the key pair, however you can use a password to connect to the Instance.
To re-associate a key pair, you might need to open theknown_hostsorhostsfile on your local machine and delete all rows/entries related to the Instance(s) using the SSH key pair.

Apiculus enables customer life cycle management using states depending on where the relationship with individual customers stands in their life cycle. The following states are supported:
Credit limits, resource limits, and other general availability restrictions apply as usual.
Account states can be changed by going into the target account and selecting the appropriate action from the ellipsis (...) menu at top of the account details pane, next to theImpersonatebutton.
Most automation policies created on Apiculus provide the option to automatically change account states whenever a specified trigger condition is met. This can be used to automate scenarios like dunning, trial expiry, or disabling access for unverified accounts. These automated state changes can be configured using the Automation section, either globally or at the account level. Automated state changes can be overridden (unless terminated automatically) manually.
It is recommended that an automated termination action be used with utmost caution, as there will be no way to reverse the action.
The Apiculus Accounts API provides options to manage account states programmatically. Programmatic state changes can be overridden (unless terminated) manually.
It is recommended that programmatic termination be used with utmost caution, as there will be no way to reverse the action.
Working with Account States
Active- These are accounts that are active and have no special restrictions applied to their usage of cloud services. Active accounts can freely use the cloud to create and manage their resources, work with payments and invoices, maintain their team and profiles, and manage support interactions in the usual manner.noteCredit limits, resource limits, and other general availability restrictions apply as usual.
Restricted- These are accounts that can operate existing resources but are not allowed to purchase any new resources. This restriction is forced and supersedes any general usage or availability restrictions. Restricted accounts can be reactivated.
Disabled- These are accounts that can neither operate existing resources nor can they purchase new ones. This is similar to a 'soft-shutdown' or 'suspension' where the only permitted action is to make a payment to reactivate access to the cloud services. No resource belonging to a disabled account are deleted. Disabled accounts can be reactivated manually from the Admin Console.
Terminated- These accounts typically signify an end-of-life (EoL) state. In such cases, all the account's resources are deleted and non-recoverable. Terminated or EoL accounts can not be reactivated, as termination is an irreversible action.

Even with the Reseller module enabled and customers getting acquired via resellers, there is no impact on billing and availability of Services to the subscribers/customers. The points to consider here are:
Once an invoice is generated, payments can be received from the customers in the following ways:
Billing between service provider and reseller needs to be handled offline, and Apiculus maintains and presents all the information needed to achieve this as part of the reseller life cycle. The Metabase business intelligence and dashboard system offers aReseller Managementdashboard that shows all the required information as reports and widgets. Some of the standard reports delivered via Metabase are:
The above information can be used to generate the relevant invoices for resellers and payments can be sent offline.
For any other report requirements, a ticket can be created with Apiculus (By Yotta) Support.
Managing Billing for Resellers
All customers (reseller-tagged and otherwise) will see available Services based on the Catalogue assigned to each one of them.
Invoice are generated with the service provider as the biller (not the reseller), with charges and amounts as what is published in the Catalogues associated with the customers.
Resellers can only log in and view the account details of customers who they have onboarded using their reseller codes.
Resellers have no visibility into or control over available Services, their prices, billing, invoicing or any other customer account-level actions.Resellers are simply treated as acquisition partners, not servicing partners.

Each Instance on Apiculus (Linux or Windows) includes a 'root' disk or volume. This is the primary disk partition on the Instance, where the operating system, data, components and files reside on the root disk.
Further, Instances can have add-on or data disks attached to them which act as additional disk partitions. These data disks are modular and can be moved between multiple Instances.
Apart from this, there is no difference between a root disk and a data disk. Both types of Volumes are managed using theBlock Volumesservice. However, based on the volume type, certain operations may not be available.

Default Services (DS) is the catalogue available to all subscribers, unless specified otherwise. In other words, the DS catalogue defines the default rules for availability of any supported Service via configurations of:
Each Service in the DS catalogue has the following control levers:
The DS catalogue needs to be published before it can be made visible/available to the customers. This can be done by clicking onPUBLISH DEFAULT CATALOGUEon theServices > Default Servicessection of Apiculus Admin Console. Other points to consider while working with the DS catalogue are:
Overview
Whether a Service should be available or not?
What Availability Zone(s) should a Service be delivered from?
Which Collections and Collection Items should be delivered as part of the containing Service?
What prices to deliver the Service components at?
What billing and provisioning logic should be followed?
Availability of Service as part of the DS catalogue-¬†This is a master switch that can be used in scenarios where a Service might be deliverable only to a select subset of customers and not to everyone by default. For example, Kubernetes may be available only to customers who have had one month of successful billing; or Metal Instances may only be available to high-end Enterprise customers.
Options to govern billing, delivery, and provisioning parameters- Each Service in the DS catalogue has options to control billing pro-ration, the option to choose which AZs to enable, and whether the Service should follow a self-service provisioning model or need approval from the service provider admin; choosing an approval-based provisioning model presents other options around how to handle approvals.
Options to control pricing and availability of Collections and Collection Items-¬†For each AZ enabled as part of a Service in the DS catalogue, its mapped Collections and Collection Items will become available for configuring pricing and whether to deliver them or not.

Any new Collection or Collection Item published in the system will get added to the corresponding Service in the catalogue in a disabled state and needs to be manually enabled to be part of the catalogue.
Any change made to the Availability Zones section (inside a Service in the DS catalogue) requires the catalogue to be updated for the AZ and its collection details to show up in the catalogue.
The DS catalogue does not differentiate between self-service, admin-assisted or admin-initiated accounts.

Instances are computing units that provide you with resources to run your applications/workloads. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Instances are virtual machines that run the images of RHEL Operating System.
The Apiculus platform offers a flexible and granular pricing model for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) based on virtual CPU (vCPU) core slabs. This model allows organizations to tailor costs to their actual resource usage, making it a versatile option for businesses with varying workload demands.
Apiculus provides tiered pricing for RHEL by supporting the following core categories:
1-8 vCPUs: This slab is suitable for small to medium workloads, typically found in lightweight applications, development environments, and smaller production workloads. Pricing in this range is designed to be competitive, allowing users to optimize costs for modest resource requirements.
9-128 vCPUs: This middle tier accommodates larger workloads, such as those seen in extensive application environments, data processing, and medium-to-large production systems. Pricing for this range is aligned with Red Hat's standard, making it easier to manage costs as applications scale up.
129+ vCPUs: Designed for enterprise-grade deployments, this category caters to highly intensive applications requiring significant compute resources. These could include data analytics, machine learning workloads, and large-scale production systems. Apiculus ensures that pricing is optimized for businesses managing large virtualized environments with high vCPU demands.
Each slab follows Red Hat's established core model, ensuring transparent and predictable pricing while offering the flexibility to manage resources effectively. By aligning with Red Hat's structure, Apiculus makes it easier for businesses to plan costs accurately as they scale across different workload sizes.

Document URL - https://docs.apiculus.com/docs/Subscribers/Compute/Autoscale/AboutAutoscale
The Autoscale feature allows a system to adjust its computing resources based on the changing workload automatically. In virtual machines or instances, autoscaling helps ensure that an application or service has the right amount of resources to handle varying levels of demand efficiently. The key concept behind autoscaling is dynamic resource allocation. When demand for a particular application or service increases, autoscaling automatically adds more computing resources (such as instances or virtual machines) to handle the load. Conversely, during periods of lower demand, autoscaling reduces the number of resources to optimize cost and efficiency.

Document URL - https://docs.apiculus.com/docs/Subscribers/Networking/NATGateways/AboutNATGateways
A Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway is a networking component in cloud and on-premises environments that enables resources within a private subnet (such as virtual machines or containers) to connect to the internet or other external networks, without exposing these resources directly to incoming connections from those external networks. This helps in enhancing security in cloud infrastructure by keeping resources in private subnets isolated from direct public access.
NAT gateways work as follows:
Security Benefit:By keeping resources in private subnets and restricting internet exposure, NAT gateways enhance security for sensitive data and applications.
Sample Setup: A NAT gateway can be deployed in a public subnet within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Resources in private subnets route their outbound internet-bound traffic to this NAT gateway, which forwards it to the internet.
About NAT Gateways
NAT gateways allow resources in private subnets to initiate outbound connections to the internet for tasks like software updates, data backups, or API calls. However, they block any unsolicited inbound traffic, preventing external actors from directly accessing private resources.
When a resource (for example, a virtual machine) in a private subnet sends a request to the internet, the NAT gateway translates the private IP address of the resource into a public IP address, making the resource appear as if it is on the internet. Responses to these requests are then routed back through the NAT gateway to the initiating resource.
NAT gateways are managed services that are highly available and scalable by default. They can handle large volumes of traffic without requiring manual setup for failover or redundancy.

Creating a VPC
To view a list of sections and the various operations or actions you can perform by going inside the particular section, click on the VPC name. Below the VPC name is an informational view where you can find the details below.
VPCs follow the convention of 3-tiered architectures, with web, app, and DB tiers forming the norm. You can, however, configure these tiers to suit your application architecture or just follow the common convention.
Viewing VPC Instances
IPv4 Addresses are an integral part of using VPC networking, and need to be used to access various components of the VPC. By default, a public IPv4 Address is assigned to the VR which can communicate through the internet to transmit traffic to/from the VR. This IPv4 can also be used for configuring remote access (L2TP) and site-to-site (IPSec) VPN connections.
Access control policies can be created using Access Control Lists (ACL) and configuring rules within these ACL (called ACL Rules). An ACL can then be applied to any tier within the VPC. These policies govern what traffic is allowed or restricted into and from your VPC network tiers.
The¬†Reconfigure section/tab lists your current subscription details and allows you to reconfigure the networking pack or switch between¬†hourly and¬†monthly pricing.

L2 networks provide network isolation without any other services. This means that there will be no virtual router. It is assumed that the end user will have their own IPAM in place or that they will statically assign IP addresses.
The end-users can create L2 networks; however, network offerings that allow the network creator to specify a VLAN can only be created by the root admins.
CloudStack does not assign IP addresses to instances.
User data and metadata can be passed to the instance using a config drive (which must be enabled in the network service offering)
VPC is a higher-level abstraction that allows you to create isolated network environments with more advanced features. A VPC can include multiple tiers, such as public and private subnets, and it provides for the implementation of advanced networking features like VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) and ACLs.
The difference in Traffic Flow is simplified in the diagram below.

The VPC feature on Apiculus provides advanced networking capabilities for use with VPN gateways and connections over an IPSec tunnel. Apiculus gives the ability to create virtual private networks (VPN) to access virtual machines inside a VPC.
There are two types of VPN connections supported on Apiculus Cloud:
The underlying SDN on Apiculus Cloud provides an L2TP-over-IPsec-based remote access VPN service to VPCs and guest virtual networks. Since each VPC has its own virtual router, VPNs are not shared across the networks.
All VPN users in your account will get access to all VPNs created in your account.
Working with VPN Connections in a VPC
Remote Access VPN-To connect securely from your home or office to your VPC on Apiculus Cloud. This is used primarily when you‚Äôre using a dynamic IP to connect to the internet and a VPN connection can, therefore, not be pre-configured.
Site-to-Site VPN-To connect a private static network to your VPC on Apiculus Cloud using an IPSec tunnel. Site-to-site gateways must be pre-configured on Apiculus Cloud.

The Apiculus-powered cloud has nameservers if the service provider has enabled this service. These name servers are simply fully-qualified domain names (FQDN) for the servers that store all the domain/zone information. Typically, these name servers will be in the following format:
There are 2 main steps involved in linking your owned domains to Apiculus DNS.
Apiculus supports pricing per DNS Zone, which could be monthly or a one-time cost, depending on how the cloud service provider has priced the Service.¬†Once the Zone is created, navigate to it from the list of available DNS Zones, then go to theNameserverssection, where you will find the nameserver information.
Linking Domains to Apiculus Cloud Console
Navigate toNetworking > DNS Managementand click theNEW ZONEbutton. On Apiculus, each domain name is stored as a¬†Zone¬†file.noteApiculus supports pricing per DNS Zone, which could be monthly or a one-time cost, depending on how the cloud service provider has priced the Service.¬†Once the Zone is created, navigate to it from the list of available DNS Zones, then go to theNameserverssection, where you will find the nameserver information.
In a different tab or browser window, open the control panel of your domain name provider (e.g., Bigrock, GoDaddy, Dreamhost, etc.) and navigate to the section where DNS records are managed. There will usually be a specific area for editing nameservers. Locate this section and update the nameserver information with the values provided in theDNS Managementsection of the Apiculus Cloud Console.Once the nameservers have been propagated (which takes around 5-10 minutes), you'll be able to find your updated nameserver information if you¬†whois¬†your domain name. This also implicitly establishes your ownership of the domain.

DNS records and subdomains can be managed on Apiculus Cloud Console to be used with Instances, IPv4 Addresses and other workloads created on Apiculus-powered clouds. This only requires adomain to be linked with the Apiculus nameservers.
To view and manage the DNS records for all linked domains, navigate toNetworking > DNS Managementand select theRecordssection of the target domain or Zone.
When a DNS Zone is created, a statement of authority (SOA) record is automatically generated for the domain. This can neither be edited, nor be deleted.
New DNS records can be added by using theADD DNS RECORDbutton which will open up a simple form. The record can be of any supported type and requires the following details to be specified:
Domain:the domain or the zone in which to create the new record (will be auto-populated and non-editable).
Record Type:you can choose from the following types of records:
Name:this is the complete FQDN along with the domain name (e.g.,¬†recordname.domainname.com)
Value:the IPv4 Address that you want the record to point to.
TTL:set to 86400 as default, you can specify the TTL as per your requirement.
Once a record has been created, you can ping the record¬†Name¬†from any online or desktop command line and the response should show the IPv4 specified in the¬†Value¬†field.

Document URL - https://docs.apiculus.com/docs/Subscribers/Networking/DNSManagement/SwitchingtoAnotherDNSProvider
In case you don't want to use the DNS Management Service on your Apiculus-powered cloud, you can always switch back to another provider of choice. To do so, head to your domain name provider's control panel and update the nameserver details to those of the DNS provider you wish to use.
The following points, however, need to be considered:
Switching to Another DNS Provider
There is no option toexportDNS records from one provider to another, which means that you'll need to recreate all your DNS records with the new provider.
If you simply switch nameservers, you'll still incur billing on your Apiculus-powered cloud unless you have deleted the DNS Zone file from theOperationssection of the DNS Zone on Apiculus Cloud Console.
There might be a propagation delay while switching nameservers, which means it's always a good idea to let the nameservers propagate completely before deleting anything from Apiculus Cloud Console.

Load Balancer Instances can be created inside a VPC by following these simple steps:
The above steps create an LBI and place it in the correct spot in the network. To configure traffic management rules and access other options via the NetScaler VPX control panel, additional activation steps are needed. These instructions are sent over email when an LBI is created.
Creating a Load Balancer Instance
Navigate toNetworking > Virtual Private Cloudsand select a VPC in where LBI needs to be placed. If unavailable,create a new VPC.
In the VPC,create a subnet tierwith any desired configuration(s).
Add an additionalIPv4 Addressto the VPC and keep it 'unused'.
Navigate toNetworking > Load Balancer Instancesand click theNEW LOAD BALANCER INSTANCEbutton to access the LBI creation options.
Choose anAvailability Zone, which is the geographical region where your Instance will be deployed.
In theSelect VPC and Tiersection, specify the VPC and subnet as created in steps 1 and 2 above.
Select a Load Balancer Version.
Choose a Compute Pack from the list.
Choose the Standard Root Disks from the options and provide a name to your instance. The Instance name must only contain alphanumeric characters, underscore, dots and hyphens.
Under theSummary and Estimated Costssection, verify the estimated cost of your Instance based on the chosen specifications.
To confirm, click the check box after reviewing the policies mentioned by your cloud service provider.
Click theBUY HOURLYorBUY MONTHLYbutton. The Confirm Instance Purchase window appears, and the price summary is displayed along with the discount codes if you have any in your account.You can apply any of the discount codes listed by clicking on theAPPLYbutton.You can also remove the applied discount code by clicking theREMOVEbutton.You can cancel this action by clicking on theCANCELbutton.

IPv4 Addresses are an integral part of using VPC networking, and need to be used to access various components of the VPC. By default, a public IPv4 Address is assigned to the VR which can communicate through the internet to transmit traffic to/from the VR. This IPv4 can also be used for configuring remote access (L2TP) and site-to-site (IPSec) VPN connections.
Primarily, IPv4 Addresses can be used for configuring access and NAT-ing via:
As a first step, a new IPv4 Address needs to be added to the VPC, which can be done using theADD PUBLIC IPv4 ADDRESSbutton.
Public IPv4 addresses may carry a price which may vary depending on availability of IPv4 addresses in the country of operation, and/or how the service provider has priced them.
To configure the Load Balancing Rule, follow these steps:
Once the load balancer rule has been created, you can navigate to load balancer and add (or remove) Instances to this rule. To do this, follow these steps:
To delete this Load Balancing Rule, clickDELETE THIS RULE.
To verify the load balancer configuration, log into each virtual machine behind it, create anindex.htmlfile with different content on each, and access the public IP address from your browser. If configured correctly, each browser page refresh should take turns in loading the two index.html pages.
A load balancer IP rule can only be configured if the tier/subnet type is set toPublic IP.
A Port Forwarding rule is required for accessing the virtual machines contained in a VPC. Since virtual machines in a VPC only have a private IP address, a public IP address is required for each virtual machine that you want to access from your terminal.
To configure port forwarding, follow these steps:
The end ports¬†should be equal to or greater than the¬†start ports.
Once the Port-Forwarding rule is created, you can view its details by following these steps:
To test if port-forwarding is configured correctly, use the public IP to SSH into the virtual machine the IP forwards to.
A Port-Forwarding IP address can be used to configure multiple Port-Forwarding access rules but with one virtual machine. To port-forward into a different virtual machine, you‚Äôll need to purchase an additional public IP address.
To test whether static NAT has been configured correctly, you can use the public IP to SSH into the virtual machine that the IP is NAT-ing to.

To access the ACL navigate toVPC detailsand select theAccess Control Liststab. You can perform the following actions on any available ACL:
You can create a custom ACL by clicking theADD ACCESS CONTROL LISTbutton and assigning a name to the ACL. An ACL is a collection of individual traffic control rules that must be configured after the ACL is created.
Any available ACL (existing or new) can be viewed in detail by clicking its name in the list. This displays a list of rules that govern ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic for the subnet. From this section, you can create new rules or delete existing ones.
